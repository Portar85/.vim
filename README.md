Berk D. Demir's Vim configuration.

## Version ##
Target version is Vi IMproved 7.3 on Mac OS X.
Things will probably work with somewhat older and also newer versions
of Vim on other operatings systems.

## Installation ##
Majority of extensions and themes are coming from external
repositories which are added as submodules.  So git submodule system has
to be initialized for the installation and these submodules should be
updated.

    git submodule update --init --recursive
